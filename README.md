2. View detailed information about selected anime — including title, synopsis, rating,
   episodes, and genres.
3. Explore popular, upcoming, and top-rated anime lists through categorized tabs or
   sections.
4. Add anime to a “Favorites” or “Watchlist” section, stored locally on the device.
5. (Bonus) Display character details or related anime using additional endpoints from the
   API.
